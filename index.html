        <a href="https://secret-everglades-72811.herokuapp.com/"><big>SitterSetter</big></a>
        <p> My very first app idea come to fruition! The first "job title" I've ever had was babysitter. Scheduling babysitting gigs with different families was always difficult. I know it was even harder for many of the parents I worked for who were constantly
          juggling babysitters sending texts back and forth for days trying to make the times work! </p>
        <p> SitterSetter allows parents to authorize babysitters to see their open babysitting times. Parents can create a new babysitting job, request a specific sitter, and remove a sitter at any time. They also have the option to give instructions or
          helpful pieces of information for the babysitter in the description box upon creating a gig! </p>

        <p> Trippin' is a month-based planner where you can also view other events and/or trips people have gone on; you may also sort through events by Name, Location, Start Time, Cost and Duration. If you like their event ideas, you can add their events to your very own trip or create your own events. </p>
        <p> Includes a personalized calendar view with trip dates highlighted AND multiple map views rendered with marked events using the Google Maps API</p>

        <p> This is a blogging app that we created in class when we were first introduced to rails. It really helped teach me the foundations of routing and how the backend of an application might function. </p>

        <p> This digital clock displays the time as well as contains a background that mimics the movements of the sun as the day goes on. If you don't believe me, you should check in the morning, afternoon, evening, and nighttime and get back to me. </p>
